## Blocked / Impossible

### 10. Private Company Revenue Data
- **Examples**: Anthropic revenue, Together AI revenue, Replicate revenue
- **Why Blocked**: Private companies don't disclose financials

  - Use funding announcements as proxy (valuation, implied ARR multiples)
  - Cite industry analyst estimates (Gartner, IDC) if available
  - Interview-based data (CEO statements in press, with attribution)
- **Status**: 🚫 Blocked (unless leaked or acquired)

### 11. Unreleased Product Roadmaps
- **Examples**: Future OpenAI features, Google Gemini roadmap
- **Why Blocked**: Not publicly announced, only rumors
- **Workarounds**:
  - Mark as `confidence: "rumored"` if credible leaker
  - Wait for official announcement before adding to event layer
- **Status**: 🚫 Blocked (intentionally, maintains quality standards)
